        Ok. I know, I know!  Here must be a form for expenses adding. But because I've desided do make whole the expenses app from zero only by myself (just an attempt to understand the things better - I need it for sure), so I just had no time today to complete the form and the adding support. Doesn't metter, I'll complete everything tomorrow.
